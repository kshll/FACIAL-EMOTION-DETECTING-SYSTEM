# FACIAL-EMOTION-DETECTING-SYSTEM
This project implements a real-time facial emotion recognition system using a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM neural network architecture. It provides a FastAPI backend that captures webcam images, detects faces, and classifies emotions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.
